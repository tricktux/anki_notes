## Teaching the value of things

- The way you do this to your kids is by giving them incentives (maybe I need to work on this, but for now the
	incentive could be money) for the work they do.
- This way lets say they want something. Very well I will give you incentives for tasks that you perform.
- This tasks need to be outside of regular tasks that need to be the kids responsibility.
- Also need to think about how you are going to treat good grades. Are these expected or highly rewarded. I think they
	should be not expected but neither highly rewarded. There should some kind of reward but not too high.
