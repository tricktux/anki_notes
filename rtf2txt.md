- Mon Oct 10 2016 10:17 
- To use it kinda of in batch mode:
	- `cd` to the folder with the `*.rtf`
	- `for %f in (*.rtf) do rtf2txt "%f"`
	- Make sure that `rtf2txt` is in your path
- For big files it may take a while to do so. But if finishes at the end. You
  can check the status by going to `Ctrl+Alt+Esc` and seeing the process
	working.
