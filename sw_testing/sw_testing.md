## System level testing

Includes a wide spectrum of testing
functionality testing
stress testing
load testing
security testing
reliability testing

## Regression testing

Idea is to ensure that modifications have not introduced new faults

## Acceptance testing

Normally performed by the customer
The system is handed to the customer after system level testing for acceptance testing
